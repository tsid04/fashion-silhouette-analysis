# Features
- Converts RGB images to grayscale manually
- Contrast stretching and Gaussian smoothing
- Automatic silhouette extraction using Otsu thresholding
- Morphological cleanup and largest-blob selection
- Measures silhouette width at 25%, 50%, and 75% of body height
- Generates visualization images with measurement lines
- Computes and visualizes HOG features for each image
